# Treasure-Hunter-Game

* A treasure hunter is trying to find diamonds in a 10x10 field. Each diamond is guarded by a soldier. 
The aim of the hunter is to collect the diamonds without being caught by the soldiers.

* The hunter's starting position on the board is fixed. So each time the game starts, the hunter's position will be (2,4).

* There are 5 diamonds on the field and these diamonds must be placed in random cells when the game first starts. The player will not see the diamonds on the board. While diamonds are randomly assigned to cells, it should be prevented that more than one diamond coincide with the same cell. (You can use the rand() function to determine a random position).

* Every diamond has a guardian. This guard will be randomly placed in one of the cells adjacent to the diamond. Even if 2 diamonds are randomly placed on adjacent positions on the board, they will each have a separate guardian and a guardian cannot be in the same cell with another guardian or diamond.
